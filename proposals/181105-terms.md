# Tari Network Terminology
Below are a list of terms and their definitions that are used throughout the Tari code and documentation. Let's use 
this glossary to disambiguate ideas, and work towards a 
[ubiquitous language](https://blog.carbonfive.com/2016/10/04/ubiquitous-language-the-joy-of-naming/) for this project.  

## Block reward
[Block Reward]: #block_reward 'The amount of Tari created in every block'

The amount of Tari created in every block

## Blockchain
[blockchain]: #blockchain 'A sequence of Tari blocks'

A sequence of [Tari block]s. Each block contains a hash of the previous valid block. Thus the blocks form a chain 
with the property that changing anything in a block other than the head block requires rewriting the entire 
blockchain from that point on.

## Coinbase transaction 
[Coinbase Transaction]: coinbase_transaction 

The first transaction in every Tari block yields a [Block Reward] according to the Tari [Emmission Schedule] and is 
awarded to the miner that performed the [Proof of Work] for the block.

## Emmission Schedule
[Emmission Schedule]: #emmision_schedule 

An explicit formula as a function of the block height, _h_, that determined what the block reward for the 
_h_<sup>th</sup> block is.

## Transactions
[transaction]: #transactions 

Transactions are activities recorded on the Tari [blockchain]. The types of transactions accepted on the Tari 
blockchain are:
* [Coinbase transaction]s
* _Spend transactions_. Here one or more UTXOs are destroyed (the input UTXOs), yielding a new set of UTXOs whose value
 sum to the sum of the input UTXO value minus the transaction fee.
* _Checkpoint transactions_. A special spend transaction that contains a single input UTXO, an optional 
change UTXO, timestamped and signed merkle root, and a transaction fee. _Does this *need* to be a separate 
transactino type, or should we allow an arbitrary number of merkle proofs in standard spend transactions?_

## Tari Coin
[tari coin]: #tari_coin

The base layer token.
 
## Unspent transaction outputs
[utxo]: #unspent_transaction_outputs

An unspent transaction output (UTXO) is a discrete number of Tari that are available to be spent. The sum of all 
UTXOs represents all the Tari currently in circulation. In addition, the sum of all UTXO values equals the sum of the
 [block reward]s for all blocks up to the current block height.
 
UTXO values are hidden by their commitments. Only the owner of the UTXO and (presumably) the creator of the UTXO 
(either a [Coinbase transaction] or previous spender) know the value of the UTXO.
